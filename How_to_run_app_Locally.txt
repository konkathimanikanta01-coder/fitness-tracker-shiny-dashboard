Instructions for Running the App Locally

How to Run This Shiny App Locally

1. Unzip the folder `FitnessPal-FitnessTracker.zip`.
2. Open RStudio.
3. Go to "File > Open Project" (or open RStudio in the folder).
4. Open the file `app.R`.
5. Install the required packages if you don’t already have them:
  ```r
  install.packages(c("shiny", "ggplot2", "dplyr", "DT", "shinyBS", "shinycssloaders", "lubridate"))
  ```
6. Run the app using the "Run App" button in RStudio "or":
  ```r
  shiny::runApp()
  ```
7. The app will open in your browser. Make sure `dataset_garmin_activity.csv` stays in the same folder as `app.R`.

8. Make sure to use only the csv file provided in the zip file and also set it as working directory.
